NW Calgary's [Northland Village Mall](http://northlandvillagemall.ca/) has a Bitcoin ATM!

Who knew?

It takes cash. Too bad it's broke.

Not _broken_... broke!

I put $20 CAD into the machine and it apologized for _being out of Bitcoin_!

It turns out it doesn't take five or ten dollar bills either.

At the time of posting, the [General Bytes](https://www.generalbytes.com/) Bitcoin ATM at Northland Mall is charging $11,433.99. Exorbitant in comparison to the popular crypto exchanges, which are generally hovering around $10,300.

Still, with the exchanges' own exorbitant transfer fees, I prefer being able to just buy Bitcoin down at the mall. But, like the mall itself, the ATM is broke as a joke.
